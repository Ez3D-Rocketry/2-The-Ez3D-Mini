# Ez3D-Mini

- Great park flyer that uses mini A motors
- Parts tape together
- No glue required

# Parts List:
1. Ez3D-1350-4 Fin Can
2. BT-50 Nose Cone
3. 13mm Retainer Cap
   - Print out the multiple sizes (No scaling, +3%, +5%), These account for different printing tolerances and post flight shrinking.
4. Six (6) inches of BT-50 type body tube
   - A standard 18 inch tube makes three kits
   - 3D printable tube cutting guide included in repository files
5. Three (3) feet of Kevlar string for Recovery Harness
   - Flight tested on 9KM DWLIFE Black Braided Kevlar Cord (1.3mm, 300 lb) but others may work
6. Twelve (12) inches of streamer (Optional)
7. Tape

# Assembly: 
     
1. Tie Recovery Harness to hole in Fin Can
2. Thread Recovery Harness thru Body Tube
3. Slide Body Tube onto top of Fin Can
4. Tape Body Tube to Fin Can - avoid blocking integrated launch lug
5. Tie loose end of Recovery Harness to Nose Cone
6. Tie streamer to Recovery Harness near top of Nose Cone

**NOTE: Individual printers and filament have different tolerances** <br />
**- Fit check items before assembly. Options to adjust if necessary:**
- Add tape to increase diameter
- Remove material by sanding
- If your printer has a scaling feature, use it to adjust the part size
- Change the dimensions in the FreeCAD file

# Launch Preparation:
1. Insert 1 or 2 squares of recovery wadding into Body Tube
2. Load Recovery Harness and Streamer into Body Tube
3. Place Nose Cone on top of Body Tube - ensure slightly snug fit
4. Load motor into Fin Can
5. Screw Motor Retention Cap onto base of Fin Can
   - Depending on your printer, the larger sizes may fit better
   - After a flight or two, the smaller size may fit better
6. Launch using standard model rocket procedures


# Recommended motors and expected performance: 



1/2A3-2T   = 93 ft  (Optimum delay = 2 s)

A10-3T      = 240 ft (Optimum delay = 2.95 s)

A3-4T       = 273 ft (Optimum delay = 3.3 s)


# IMPORTANT POST FLIGHT NOTES:
- 3D printed material shrinks after cooling down from heat of motor
- Removal of motor may be difficult or impossible after one or several flights
- The smaller motor retainer cap may fit better after the first flight
- If existing motor retainer caps no longer work, friction or tape may suffice for retention
- PLA filament most suspectable to shrinking. Others may last longer.

## Entire kit fits in a Ziplock sandwich bag!
